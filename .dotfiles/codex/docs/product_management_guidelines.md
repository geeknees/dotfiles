# Product Philosophy & Development Process Guidelines

### **Preface: Why This Guideline Exists**

This guideline is a framework for how to think—so you can evolve from a mere task executor into someone who truly creates value. This is not an instruction manual. It is a philosophy for building great products, and a compass that helps you autonomously maximize impact.

What we aim for is product development with enough force to “put a dent in the universe,” as Steve Jobs once said. For that, pursuing technical output—writing code, implementing features—is nowhere near sufficient. What you must pursue is **outcome**: real results that solve customer problems, grow the business, and create positive change in the world. Ask yourself: **Is my output contributing to a real outcome?**

This guideline integrates three core ideas from world-class product development. First, the philosophy of **Product Discovery**, represented by works like ***Inspired*** and **The Lean Startup**, which begins with deep empathy for customers. Second, the discipline of **Clean Agile**, which emphasizes rigor and quality while sustaining a healthy pace of delivery over time. Combined, these give you a repeatable framework to **build the right thing—and build the thing right**.

This journey begins with the “philosophy” that underlies great products.

## **Part 1: Product Philosophy — Creating Products Customers Love**

### **1. Mission: Focus on Outcomes, Not Outputs**

What does success in product development mean? If you define it wrong, all your effort becomes meaningless. Success cannot be measured by lines of code or the number of shipped features. Success must be measured only by **outcomes**—whether we solved a deep customer problem and achieved meaningful business goals. Understanding this principle is the starting point of every strategy. By the end of this chapter, you’ll begin to see feature requests not as tasks, but as hypotheses for producing business impact.

Peter Drucker, one of the giants of management, described the operating principle of effective executives as follows: **“Effective executives focus on opportunities rather than problems.”** They don’t treat change as a threat; they treat it as an opportunity and discover new possibilities for value creation. This mindset applies perfectly to product development. Your mission is not merely to solve the problem you were given. Your mission is to view the change behind it as an opportunity—and to create a new future for customers.

The power of “focus” is symbolized by an episode from Steve Jobs’ return to Apple in 1997. He took the chaotic product lineup and reduced it to just four products that fit into a simple 2×2 grid on a whiteboard: consumer vs. professional, desktop vs. laptop. This decision demonstrates the essence of strategy: by deciding what *not* to do, you concentrate resources on what matters most—and produce extraordinary outcomes.

To clearly understand the difference in these two mindsets, review the comparison below.

|                                 |                                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Output Thinking (avoid)**     | **Outcome Thinking (aim for)**               |
| Implement more features, faster | How did customer behavior change?            |
| Release on schedule             | How did key business metrics (KPIs) improve? |
| Write code and complete tasks   | What customer problem did we solve?          |
| What we build                   | Why we build it                              |

The path to the right outcome always begins with deep customer understanding. Understanding real customer needs is the only light that can illuminate the road ahead.

### **2. Customer: The Source of All Truth**

Every great product is born not from the pursuit of technology, but from deep understanding of people. Understanding customers is not just one step in the development process—it is the core activity at the heart of our product philosophy. Technology is only a means. The goal is always to solve customer problems and create delight.

Steve Jobs’ obsession with product development embodies this philosophy. David Kelley, founder of IDEO, shares an iconic story about building the first mouse. Jobs cared even about the sound made by the prototype’s ball; to achieve a quiet user experience, he demanded a rubber coating. This fixation on detail wasn’t mere perfectionism—it was deep consideration for the customer, a desire to make every moment of interaction the best it could be. Jobs believed computers needed to have “life” in them. That belief became the product’s “soul,” going beyond functionality to create an emotional connection with users.

Ashton Kutcher, who played Jobs in a film, learned a crucial lesson during preparation. He realized that mimicking Jobs’ walk or speech wasn’t enough. He concluded that it mattered less to know **what kind of person** Jobs was than to understand **why he became that way**. This is exactly the stance you must take in product development. Don’t stop at hearing surface-level demands like “I want this feature.” You must explore the “why” beneath them—the underlying motivations, problems, and emotions. In other words, “I want this feature” is the customer’s “walk.” What you must uncover is the deeper “why.”

Insights gained through deep empathy become the source of valuable hypotheses. And the process of validating those hypotheses leads us to the next step where innovation is born.

### **3. The Build–Measure–Learn Loop: The Engine of Innovation**

Ideas alone have no value. To turn ideas into real value, you need a systematic process. At the center is the **Build–Measure–Learn** feedback loop proposed by The Lean Startup—an engine that accelerates innovation while minimizing risk in highly uncertain environments.

You can understand this loop visually using the system-thinking concept of **stocks and flows**. Consider the “bathtub system structure (Figure 5)” shown in `system.pdf`.

* **Build = Inflow:** Implement the minimum set of functionality needed to test value, based on a new idea or hypothesis. This corresponds to pouring water into a bathtub.
* **Product = Stock (the water in the tub):** The product or feature released to the market. This represents our current state.
* **Measure = Outflow:** Collect behavioral data and feedback on how users actually used the product. This corresponds to observing the water flowing out of the bathtub.

Most importantly, this is not a one-way process. The results of **Measure** (the outflow) determine what we **Build** next (the inflow), forming a **feedback loop**. This loop is not merely a sequence—it is a self-improving engine. The **quality and speed** of feedback obtained through “Measure” directly determine the effectiveness of the next “Build.” By spinning this loop fast, you continuously reflect market learning into the product and evolve the “stock” toward a state where customer value is maximized.

Steve Jobs’ decision to discontinue the Newton handheld device after returning to Apple is an example of practicing this loop. Based on market feedback (Measure), he judged Newton was not contributing to Apple’s desired outcomes. He then learned and pivoted strategically—reallocating resources toward core products like the iMac.

To run the Build–Measure–Learn loop efficiently and sustainably as a team, you need discipline in your actual development process.

## **Part 2: Development Process — Principles of Clean Agile**

### **4. Team and Roles: Shared Responsibility as Professionals**

Great products are not created by individual heroics. They are created by collaboration within a disciplined, professional team. This chapter is designed to shift your thinking from “individual contribution” to “shared responsibility as a team.” Clean Agile begins by cultivating a culture where the entire team jointly owns quality and results. Roles exist, but their purpose is not to create silos; it is to apply expertise toward a shared goal.

Drucker also stated that a key requirement of effective executives is the ability to **think and speak in terms of “we.”** The same applies to development teams. The ultimate decision-maker must be clear, but in day-to-day work you must prioritize organizational needs and opportunities over personal tasks or convenience. Team success is not the sum of individual wins—it is achieved only when everyone collaborates toward a common goal.

In such a professional environment, high standards are required. Jobs expressed his leadership philosophy with a famous line: **“It’s not my job to be easy on you. It’s my job to make you better.”** This isn’t simply harshness. It reflects deep professional commitment—to draw out the full potential of team members so they can surpass self-imposed limits and achieve extraordinary results. This is a posture shared by the best leaders: they promise growth, not comfort. That tough love is the boundary between ordinary teams and great ones.

To produce high-quality work reliably, a team needs a consistent “rhythm” that everyone follows.

### **5. Development Rhythm: Iteration and Flow**

To ensure predictability and deliver value continuously, a stable rhythm in agile development is strategically essential. Instead of ad-hoc, reactive development, disciplined cadence enables sustainable pace and allows stakeholders to predict future outcomes.

This rhythm aligns with Drucker’s principle: **“Make an action plan.”** In agile, sprint/iteration planning corresponds to this. At the start of each iteration, the team defines the “desired outcomes” clearly and creates a concrete plan to achieve them. This ensures the team’s effort is always aimed at the highest-value goals.

You can understand development process management using the “stock and flow” concept shown in `system.pdf`. Drucker’s “action plan” is a strategic intervention to intentionally control our “flow” and process “stock” predictably.

* **Stock:** The set of unstarted tasks in the product backlog—the total amount of work to be done.
* **Flow:** The amount of work the team can complete in a fixed period (velocity).
* **Goal:** Make this flow stable and sustainable. If flow is stable, we can process the backlog (stock) at a predictable pace.

Drucker also noted that **action plans should be reviewed frequently**. This perfectly explains the value of reviews and retrospectives at the end of each iteration. Plans are not “done” once written, nor are they fixed. They are living documents, continuously revised and improved through learning from the market, customers, and the team’s own experience.

To keep delivering value in a stable rhythm, the “quality” of what we deliver must be absolutely assured.

### **6. Commitment to Quality: Build the Right Thing the Right Way**

Sacrificing quality for short-term speed is one of the most dangerous traps in product development. It creates **technical debt** that drastically reduces future development productivity—and ultimately destroys the product’s long-term value. True professionalism is not about balancing speed and quality as trade-offs; it is about treating quality as a prerequisite for speed.

Stories about Jobs’ perfectionism illustrate the importance of uncompromising commitment to quality. One well-known Pixar-era anecdote says he gave relentless feedback even on the realism of seaweed in *Finding Nemo*. This “God is in the details” philosophy was consistent—from Pixar animation all the way to product quality standards. Its influence can be seen in the next generation of entrepreneurs. For example, Box founder Aaron Levie has said a lesson learned from Jobs was: **don’t rush a product out the door if it isn’t perfect.**

This might sound like it contradicts the Lean Startup concept of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). But the two are not in conflict. An MVP means “imperfect, but sufficient to validate the core value hypothesis.” Jobs’ philosophy implies a high bar: even if the scope is limited, what you release must deliver an excellent experience within that scope. Even an MVP must not neglect the quality of the experience.

By integrating these principles and seeing the full picture of great product development, our path forward becomes clearer.

## **Conclusion: The Spirit of Great Product Development**

The principles outlined in this guideline do not work in isolation. They become powerful only when they reinforce one another. Great product development is a dynamic process where these three elements are integrated:

* **Customer-centered philosophy:** All activity starts from deep understanding and empathy for customers. You must always ask, “For whom?” and “Why?”
* **Experimental process:** Treat ideas as hypotheses and validate them continuously through the Build–Measure–Learn loop. This helps you overcome uncertainty and maximize learning.
* **Professional execution:** A disciplined team delivers value continuously in a stable rhythm, with no compromise on quality.

This journey never ends. Markets change. Customer expectations evolve. Technology keeps advancing. What’s required is a spirit of continual learning and challenge. The words Steve Jobs used to close his commencement speech—originally quoted by Stewart Brand—capture this spirit perfectly:

**Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.**

Never be satisfied with the status quo. Keep the curiosity to explore the unknown, and the courage to question “common sense” and challenge it. That is the spirit this guideline ultimately aims to cultivate.
